#### POInterest - London Airbnb Explorer ####

A tool that uses Overpass API & Selenium to find the optimal environment of Airbnbs for specific traveler types out of Airbnb, Openstreetmaps & Google Maps. It is visualized with a Tableau Dashboard which:
* filters your individual needs and interests
* checks for fair prices and good ratings with help of a regression model
* helps you understanding your neighbourhood 
* books you an Airbnb directly in the Dashboard
