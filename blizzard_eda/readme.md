# SQL-API Project: Analyzing the Impact of Weather on Flight Performance

This project combines SQL, Python, and API skills to analyze the impact of weather on flight performance. The objective is to gain insights into how different weather conditions affect flights in different cities. The project utilizes historical flight data and weather data to identify a weather event that led to flight cancellations. By analyzing and correlating the data, the project aims to provide valuable knowledge about the relationship between weather and flight performance.

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Getting data on flights**: Download flight data for specific years and months from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics website. Clean the data, select relevant columns, and filter for a set of origin airports. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
2. **Connecting to the SQL database**: Establish a connection to the SQL database and join the flights data with the airports table to enrich the dataset with airport information.
3. **Obtaining historical weather data**: Sign up for the Meteostat API and retrieve historical weather data for the chosen month/year and locations. Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis.
4. **Performing EDA on both tables**: Conduct a thorough EDA on both the flights and weather datasets. Formulate hypotheses regarding the relationship between the datasets and investigate them through data exploration. Identify any correlations or unexpected findings.

This project provided an opportunity to apply SQL, Python, and API skills in a real-world scenario and gain insights into the impact of weather on flight performance.
