# Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys

The main goal of this project was, to get hands on experience in extensive data cleaning. 

This project aims to analyze exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute to address the following questions:

* Is there a correlation between short tenure and resignations due to dissatisfaction among employees?
* Are younger employees more likely to resign due to dissatisfaction compared to their older counterparts?
