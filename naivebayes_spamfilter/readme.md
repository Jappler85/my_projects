# Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes


In this guided project, I managed to build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The filter had an accuracy of 98.74% on the test set being used.

To train the algorithm, used a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that have already been classified by humans. 
The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).
