# Exploratory Data Analysis on Youtube Videos
This guided project focused on daily statistics for trending YouTube videos. The purpose of this project was to guide us through the process of performing an EDA, including data cleaning, feature engineering, hypothesis formulation, and testing. By this code-along, I gained an understanding of:

* How to approach an EDA
* The different components of an EDA
* Commonly used lines of code in an EDA
* Building and answering hypotheses
* Objective

The objective of this project was to familiarize us with the steps involved in an EDA by using daily statistics for trending YouTube videos as an example dataset. Throughout this project, i learned how to:

* Clean and preprocess the data to ensure its quality and usability.
* Perform feature engineering to derive meaningful insights from the available data.
* Formulate hypotheses based on the dataset and the questions you want to address.
* Test the hypotheses using appropriate statistical methods and techniques.
* Analyze and interpret the results obtained from the hypothesis testing phase.
